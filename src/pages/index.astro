  <Section title="About">
    <p class="text-muted-foreground text-justify">
      <b>Welcome to my personal homepage!</b><br />
      I’m an enthusiastic software developer with a strong passion for building efficient
      and user-friendly applications. My journey into tech began during my school
      years in Uzbekistan, where I first became curious about how software works.<br
      />
      Since moving to Germany, I’ve focused on deepening my knowledge through both
      academic and practical experience. I completed my vocational training (Ausbildung)
      as an IT specialist in application development at
      <Link href="https://infolytics.com/">Infolytics AG</Link>, where I
      currently contribute to the development of modern web applications using
      Angular, Spring Boot, and tools like Docker, GitLab, and Playwright.<br />
      My work focuses on automation, clean code, and agile collaboration. My main
      interests include full-stack development, test automation, and software architecture.<br
      />
      Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, strength training, and exploring new technologies.
      When I’m not coding, you’ll find me at the bouldering gym, playing beach volleyball,
      or in the kitchen. Feel free to explore my timeline to learn more about my
      skills, projects, and journey!

      <ProjectCard heading="Test Automation Tool for AGLA Module Validation - Commercial Project">
        Developed an external test automation tool for validating calculation
        results in the AGLA module for BIH, a German federal organization. Built
        with Angular and Docker, the tool was integrated into a GitLab CI/CD
        pipeline. Designed reusable components, implemented form validations,
        and enabled REST-based backend communication. Additionally, I wrote
        Playwright-based system tests to automate key user workflows and improve
        regression testing. The project focused on increasing test coverage,
        reducing manual effort, and ensuring data consistency across calculation
        scenarios.
